# README for https://jake-lee630.github.io/baek-yerin/

This website was made in summer 2023 in order to practice my HTML/CSS and 
some Javascript and JQuery skills. Used basic HTML and CSS (Flexbox).

I enjoy Yerin Baek's music, hence the theme for the website.
All of Yerin Baek's discography should be on here as well as links (Spotify & Apple music)
to the respective albums/singles/ep's.
